### First Lane B merge (Task 13, 2026-11-02)

- Setup: the sandbox refused to create the worktree (it may not write `.claude/` files there, nor `.git/config` for a sparse checkout). Einar created `.worktrees/lane-b` himself; sandboxed commits inside it work.
- Task 13 (`a411e47`) passed its combined review in round 1 and was merged into `m1/phase-1` as `436854d` (`--no-ff`). No conflicts; the lockfile change was only the reviewed `zod` addition, so no merge security review was needed. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` was clean.
- After the merge: harness 27/27; lint, typecheck and check:slugs exit 0; Vitest 7 files, 145 tests. Database, run after Task 5's security review had finished probing the live stack: `pnpm db:reset && pnpm db:test` Files=5, Tests=183, PASS.
- Lint in the main checkout now ignores `.worktrees/**` (`153eda0`): it had been linting the worktree's copy of `eslint.config.mjs`. `m1/lane-b` was fast-forwarded to the merge so Lane B continues from the phase branch.

### Lane B merge 2 (Task 14, 2026-11-02)

- Task 14 (`8452545`, fixes `82d08f5`, `e6dbcd8`) was merged into `m1/phase-1` as `3810375` (`--no-ff`). The merge waited until Lane A's Task 6 implementer was idle, so files did not change under it. No conflicts; the lockfile was the reviewed one; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` was clean.
- After the merge: harness 27/27; lint, typecheck and check:slugs exit 0; Vitest 13 files, 175 tests; `pnpm db:reset && pnpm db:test` Files=6, Tests=282, PASS (Task 6 included).

### Interface note for Task 16 and the sites (Task 15, 2026-11-02)

- A `link` field that references an entry projects to `{ entry: EntrySummary | null }`; `{ entry: null }` means the referenced entry is not published (spec §6.2). External links project to `{ href }` with a canonical URL. The plan's Task 15 test text (`related: EntrySummary | null`) assumed a bare reference field, which the slice does not have; the controller ratified the adaptation (`task-15-r1-spec-quality.md`).
